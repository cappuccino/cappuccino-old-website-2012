 <pre> Welcome to Cappuccino!
======================

Introduction
------------
Cappuccino is an open source framework that makes it easy to build
desktop-caliber applications that run in a web browser.

Cappuccino is built on top of standard web technologies like JavaScript, and
it implements most of the familiar APIs from GNUstep and Apple's Cocoa
frameworks. When you program in Cappuccino, you don't need to concern yourself
with the complexities of traditional web technologies like HTML, CSS, or even
the DOM. The unpleasantries of building complex cross browser applications are
abstracted away for you.

For more information, see http://cappuccino.org.

System Requirements
-------------------
To run Cappuccino applications, all you need is a web browser that understands
JavaScript.

To build Cappuccino itself, please read more here :

  - http://wiki.github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/getting-and-building-the-source

If you're using Windows, you'll also need Cygwin: http://www.cygwin.com/

Finally, if you want to easily stay up to date with the latest developments
and contribute your work back to the Cappuccino community, you'll want to
install Git: http://git-scm.com/

Getting Started
---------------
These instructions are for building a development copy of Cappuccino. If you'd
just like to get started using Cappuccino for your web apps, you should
instead download a pre-compiled copy of Cappuccino from:

    http://cappuccino.org/download/

To build Cappuccino from source, check out the most recent stable version from github:

    $ git clone git://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino.git (git)

or download the zipball of the most recent source code:

    http://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/zipball/master (zip)

If this is your first build and your system does not have narwhal and jake installed,
run the bootstrap script to install it and all of its dependencies:

    $ ./bootstrap.sh

Then, simply type "jake"  from within the root of the Cappuccino directory.
This will build a "release" copy of the frameworks. Typing "jake debug" will build a debug version.
"jake install" will build Cappuccino and associated tools and install them for general use.
